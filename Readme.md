Project: AR Pets

GroupMembers: Elijah Kelting, Xandyr Brennan

AR Pets is an AR experience where you are able to summon a pet from a QR code and take care of them in the real world, along the lins of Tamagotchi.

This project uses Unity's ZXing and AR Foundation to scan QR codes and spawn ets. To run, extract the files, and open the folder in Unity as a Unity project.
